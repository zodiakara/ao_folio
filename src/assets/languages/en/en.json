    "part-one": "Hi! I'm Agata. I've recently finished Epicode bootcamp and I proudly call myself a full-stack developer. My studies major was architecture and I've been working as an architect for 4 years until I've decided to completely switch my career path. I've always liked building things, getting to the core of problems and solving it. I have strong analytical skills and I am friendly and cooperative. My architectural background turned out to be a huge help in coding, since I can easily organize my work, split complicated tasks into small bites and I know how to meet a deadline.",
    "part-two": "I am really fascinated by coding, AI and how that's gonna influence programming and our lives and I want to be on the tech side of the fence. Click the button below to see my tech stack and if You want to get in touch, I am always one message away."
